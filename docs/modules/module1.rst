Basic Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most common models for calculating implied cost of capital include:

1. **Dividend Discount Model (DDM)**
   
   The Gordon Growth Model is a simplified version:
   
   .. math::
   
      r = \\frac{D_1}{P_0} + g
   
   Where:
   
   * :math:`r` = required rate of return (cost of equity)
   * :math:`D_1` = expected dividend next year
   * :math:`P_0` = current stock price
   * :math:`g` = constant growth rate

2. **Residual Income Model**

3. **Abnormal Earnings Growth Model**
