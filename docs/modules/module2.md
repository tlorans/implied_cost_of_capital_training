# What is the Implied Cost of Capital 

Explain, visually and slowly:
- ICC as an internal rate of return 
- Difference between: 
    - Expected return (asset pricing)
    - Implied return (valuation)

Core idea:
ICC approximates the equity yield implied by price and expected cash flows.

Cover:
- Why ICC is not equilibrium expected return
- Why mispricing can exist
- Relation to value investing and analyst sluggishness
