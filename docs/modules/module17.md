# Climate Information as Earnings-Relevant Information

## Conceptual positioning

Within the above framework, climate change does not enter as:
- a characteristic used to sort assets
- a factor assumed to command a risk premium,
- or an exogenously imposed scenario shock.

Instead, climate information enters exclusively as information that may improve conditional expectations of future earnings.

Formally, climate variables are treated as additional elements of the information set:

$$ \mathbb{E}_t[e_{i,t+h}] = \mathbb{E}[e_{i,t+h} | \mathcal{I}_t, C_{i,t}] $$

where $C_{i,t}$ denotes climate-related information available at time $t$ for firm $i$. All valuation mechanics remain unchanged.

## Why climate information fits naturally

Climate-related disclosures and events have three properties that make them relevant for earnings forecasting:
1. Cash-flow relevance: Extreme weather events, operational disruptions, and reimbursements directly affect revenues, costs, and margins.
2. Temporal structure: Some impacts are transitory (economic flows), others persistent (capital damage, insurance repricing).
3. Information frictions: Climate impacts are often disclosed in narrative form and require interpretation, making slow diffusion plausible.

These properties align closely with the types of information for which underreaction and delayed price adjustment have been documented in other contexts.

## Climate inclusion as model augmentation 

Climate information is incorporated incrementally into the earnings forecast model, for example via:
- indicators for realized climate disruptions,
- sign and direction of impact (negative, positive, reimbursement),
- persistence structures over forecast horizons,
- interaction with firm characteristics that affect exposure.

At each stage, the augmented model is evaluated using the same two criteria:
- out-of-sample earnings accuracy,
- implied discount rate behavior.

This ensures comparability across model specifications.

## Interpretation of outcomes

The framework allows several distinct interpretations:
- Forecast improvement without return predictability. Climate information improves earnings forecasts, and markets already price this information efficiently.
- Forecast improvement with return predictability. Climate information improves earnings forecasts, but prices underreact, generating predictable adjustments.
- No forecast improvement but return predictability. Climate variables proxy for systematic forecast errors or valuation distortions rather than true cash-flow effects.

These outcomes are empirically distinguishable within the same framework.

## What the framework does not assume

Importantly, the framework does not assume:
- that climate risk must be priced,
- that climate exposure commands a premium,
- or that markets are inefficient by default.

All conclusions arise from the interaction between:
- earnings expectations,
- valuation identities,
- and observed price dynamics.

## Why this approach is methodologically useful

By embedding climate information inside an earnings–valuation–pricing loop, the framework:
- avoids ad-hoc climate factor construction,
- separates cash-flow effects from discount-rate effects,
- and provides a falsifiable structure for evaluating climate relevance.

In this sense, climate change is treated neither as a “theme” nor a “factor”, but as potentially relevant information whose usefulness must be earned empirically.
