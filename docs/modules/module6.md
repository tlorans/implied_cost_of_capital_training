# Portfolio Formation: Sorting on ICC 

Core mechanics:
- Monthly ranking 
- Quintile portfolios
- Equal-weighted portfolios
- Long-short portfolio (Q5 - Q1)


discuss: 
- Why quintiles?
- Why equal weights?
- Why overlapping annual returns?

Deliverables:

- Portfolio returns for each quintile and the long-short portfolio
- Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, Sharpe ratio) for each portfolio
