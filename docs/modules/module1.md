# Getting Started

This module covers the fundamental concepts of implied cost of capital.

## Motivation and Outline 

Expected return estimates are used in many asset pricing and corporate finance studies. These applications cover diverse areas, from portfolio allocation problems (Markowitz, 1952) through factor timing (Li et al., 2014) to studying variables that influence the expected return (for example, Botosan, 1997) or variables that are influenced by the expected return (for example, Frank and Shen, 2016). 

Since the epxected return is such a central topic in finance, there is a large variety of theories and models that attempt to explain it (see Cochrane, 2011, for a summary). These include macroeconomic theories (modelling parts of the economy, such as consumption and aggregate risk, and general equilibrium models), nehavorial finance models, and factor models. 

Despite this wide range of models, the methodology used in most applied finance research settings, as well as in practice, is based on historic stock returns.
