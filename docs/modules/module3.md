# Portfolio Construction with ICC

This module covers advanced applications and considerations.

## Learning Objectives

* Apply advanced valuation models
* Understand limitations and assumptions
* Integrate with real-world data

## Advanced Models

### Multi-Stage Models

When companies experience different growth phases, multi-stage models are more appropriate.

**Two-Stage Model:**

$$P_0 = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{D_t}{(1+r)^t} + \frac{P_n}{(1+r)^n}$$

Where the terminal value $P_n$ is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model.

### Implementation Considerations

* **Data quality and availability**: Ensure you have reliable historical data
* **Model selection criteria**: Choose the appropriate model for the company stage
* **Sensitivity analysis**: Test how results change with different assumptions

```{tip}
Always perform sensitivity analysis on key parameters like growth rates and terminal values.
