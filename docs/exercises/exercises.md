## Practice Problems

### Exercise 1: Basic Calculation

Given the following information:

* Current stock price: $50
* Expected dividend next year: $2
* Growth rate: 5%

Calculate the implied cost of capital using the Gordon Growth Model.

**Solution:**

$$r = \frac{\$2}{\$50} + 0.05 = 0.04 + 0.05 = 0.09 = 9\%$$

### Exercise 2: Comparative Analysis

Compare the ICC for two companies:

| Company | Stock Price | Expected Dividend | Growth Rate |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Company A | $100 | $3 | 6% |
| Company B | $75 | $2.50 | 7% |

**Your task:** Calculate and compare their implied costs of capital.

```{admonition} Try it yourself!
:class: tip
Calculate the ICC for both companies before looking at the solution.

**Company A:**
$$r_A = \frac{3}{100} + 0.06 = 0.03 + 0.06 = 0.09 = 9\%$$

**Company B:**
$$r_B = \frac{2.50}{75} + 0.07 = 0.0333 + 0.07 = 0.1033 = 10.33\%$$

Company B has a higher implied cost of capital, suggesting higher perceived risk.

## Projects

### Final Project

Apply the concepts learned to a real company analysis.

**Requirements:**

1. Select a publicly traded company
